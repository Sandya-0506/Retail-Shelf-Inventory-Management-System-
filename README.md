INTRODUCTION:

               In todayâ€™s fast-paced retail environment, efficient inventory management is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and maximizing profitability. A Retail Shelf Inventory Management System plays a key role in monitoring and managing stock levels directly on store shelves. This system helps retailers track product availability, minimize stockouts and overstock situations, and streamline replenishment processes. By leveraging technologies such as barcode scanning, RFID, IoT sensors, and real-time data analytics, retailers can ensure accurate shelf inventory, reduce manual errors, and enhance overall store operations. This system not only supports operational efficiency but also improves the shopping experience by ensuring that products are always available when and where customers need them.

ABSTRACT:

         The Retail Shelf Inventory Management System is designed to streamline and automate the process of monitoring and managing product inventory on store shelves. Traditional inventory methods are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors, leading to issues such as stockouts, overstocking, and lost sales. This system leverages technologies like barcode scanning, RFID, and real-time data processing to provide accurate, up-to-date information on shelf stock levels. It enables timely replenishment, reduces human error, and enhances operational efficiency. By ensuring optimal product availability, the system not only improves store performance but also enhances customer satisfaction and supports data-driven decision-making in retail environment.

OBJECTIVES:

1.	Automate Shelf Inventory Tracking: To develop a system that automates the process of monitoring product quantities on retail shelves using technologies like RFID or barcode scanning.

2.	Minimize Stockouts and Overstocking: To ensure timely replenishment of products, reducing the chances of empty shelves or excess inventory.

3.	Enhance Operational Efficiency: To reduce manual effort, time, and human error involved in traditional inventory management methods.

4.	Improve Customer Satisfaction: To maintain product availability and enhance the shopping experience by ensuring customers find what they need on shelves.

5.	Provide Real-Time Data Analytics: To enable retailers to access accurate and real-time inventory data for informed decision-making.

6.	Support Inventory Forecasting: To help predict demand and manage inventory trends using historical data and analytics.

7.	Reduce Inventory Shrinkage: To track items more effectively and minimize losses due to theft, damage, or misplacement.

METHODOLOGY:

             The development of the Retail Shelf Inventory Management System involves several key phases aimed at ensuring accurate and efficient inventory monitoring on retail shelves. The methodology is structured as follows:
